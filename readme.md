# EsoFem

EsoFem is an esoteric programming language built as a python file to add to projects.

The file `esofem.py` is used for syntax and is not an interpreter. 

You put it in the same folder as the python project and use `import esofem` and call syntax from there and the file is  saved as a python file. You can call it by typing `esofem.twinkOut("Hello World!")` (Example). 

This is only an addon.
