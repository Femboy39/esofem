# EsoFem

EsoFem is an esoteric programming language built as a python file to add to projects.

The file `esofem.py` is used for syntax and is not an interpreter. 

You put it in the same folder as the python project and use `import esofem.py` and call syntax from there and the file is  saved as a python file.
